# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] - Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), 

- [ ] - when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

- [ ] - Sort the table by at least one category

- [ ] - Filter the users by at least one property.
